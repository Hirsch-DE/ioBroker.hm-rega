[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.hm-rega.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/iobroker.hm-rega/)

Connects HomeMatic CCU "Logic Layer" ("ReGaHSS") to ioBroker.

## Purpose
This Adapter keeps the HomeMatic CCU variables in sync with ioBroker and provides the possibility to start
HomeMatic CCU programs from within ioBroker. Furthermore, this adapter can be used as a "migration helper": you can sync
device/channel names, rooms, functions, and favorites from the CCU to ioBroker (this is one way only, changes in ioBroker
will be overwritten once synced again â€“ so deactivate this features after the first sync).

## Install
This adapter requires one (ore more) already installed and initialized hm-rpc adapter(s) to work.

## Configuration

## FAQ

### What are the ALARM states created in the devices object?
States which end on '_ALARM' are created by the Rega adapter, to represent service messages. The alarm has three 
different states _NO ALARM_, which indicates that there is no related alarm (service message) for the state.
When a service message appears for the related state the state will change to _ALARM_, containing the timestamp 
of the alarm occurrence on the CCU in the last changed timestamp of the state (state.ls). When you change 
the state in ioBroker, this will acknowledge the alarm in the CCU and the service message will be gone. 
The alarm state in ioBroker will change to _ACKNOWLEDGED_ still containing the occurrence timestamp 
in the last changed state, and the timestamp when it has been acknowledged in the states timestamp (state.ts).

### I have a HomeMatic CCU2/CCU3, how can I add it to the adapter settings?
Within the adapter settings, you add the IP address of your CCU2, then 
* Activate "rfd" for regular HomeMatic devices, 
* Activate "HomeMatic IP" if you use HomeMatic IP devices,
* Activate "Virtual Devices" if you use Groups in HomeMatic (so if you combine e.g. multiple thermostats to a group)

### If I modify rooms, etc. in HomeMatic, the changes are not applied right away within ioBroker.
Please reload the hm-rega adapter instance, e.g. by clicking on the reload icon of hm-rega.x (actions table) in the Instances tab.
Afterwards, wait about 10-20 seconds and then check both the Enums tab and the Objects (enum.xxx -- make sure you enable the expert mode). If the changes do still not appear, restart ioBroker. Then the changes should be available in ioBroker.

### How can I sync the hidden/invisible variables e.g. of HMIP-PSM?
Since version 2.4.0 it is possible to sync hidden variables. For this purpose you have to go to the settings of hm-rega.
At the Sync tab you will find `Invisible variables` when `Variables` is checked.

### I want to execute my own scripts on the CCU via ioBroker. Is this possible?
Since version 2.3.0 it is possible to execute your own scripts on the CCU by using the ``sendTo`` command.
E. g. getting the uptime of your CCU by the following script:

```javascript
const upTimeScript = `
    string stderr;
    string stdout;
    system.Exec("cat /proc/uptime | awk '// { printf $1/3600 }'", &stdout, &stderr);
    WriteLine(stdout);`;

sendTo('hm-rega.0', upTimeScript, res => {
    log(JSON.stringify(res), 'info');
});
```

### My Rega API is running at another port than 8181 (HTTPS: 48181), can I use the adapter anyway?
If your Rega API is running at a non default port (which should only happen in edge cases), we assume that you are familiar
with the ioBroker CLI. You can change the port via `iob set hm-rega.<instance> --homematicPort <port>`
